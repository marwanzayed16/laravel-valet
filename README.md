# Laravel Herd on Linux

If you've switched from Windows to Linux and used Laravel Herd on Windows, you might have realized that Laravel Herd isn't available on Linuxâ€”it's only available on Mac and Windows. However, you can replicate the free features of Laravel Herd on Linux. In this guide, we'll walk through the process.

## 1. Installing Multiple Versions of PHP

First, update your package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install PHP with some common extensions for Laravel:

```bash
sudo apt install php php-cli php-common php-mbstring php-xml php-mysql php-curl php-gd php-sqlite3
```

This will likely install PHP 8.1. To install PHP 8.2 or 8.3, first, add the necessary repository:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
```

Now, install PHP 8.2 and PHP 8.3 with the following commands:

### PHP 8.2

```bash
sudo apt install php8.2 php8.2-cli php8.2-common php8.2-mbstring php8.2-xml php8.2-mysql php8.2-curl php8.2-gd php8.2-sqlite3
```

### PHP 8.3

```bash
sudo apt install php8.3 php8.3-cli php8.3-common php8.3-mbstring php8.3-xml php8.3-mysql php8.3-curl php8.3-gd php8.3-sqlite3
```

## 2. Switching PHP Versions

To switch between PHP versions, use the following command:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config php
```

You'll see a list of installed PHP versions. Choose the version you want by typing the corresponding number.

To make this easier, you might want to create an alias in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

## 3. Installing Composer

Before installing Composer, install the required libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install curl unzip
```

Then, run the following commands:

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer-setup.php
```

```bash
HASH="$(curl -sS https://composer.github.io/installer.sig)"
```

```bash
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '$HASH') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
```

Finally, install Composer globally:

```bash
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
composer --version
```

## 4. Installing MySQL

Install MySQL with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Secure your installation:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Enable MySQL to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

To allow Laravel to access MySQL without using `sudo`, run:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root
```

Then, execute the following SQL commands:

```sql
USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Restart MySQL:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

## 5. Installing Node.js

Install Node.js using the following commands:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

## 6. Installing Laravel Installer

Install the Laravel Installer globally:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Add the Composer global `bin` directory to your system `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, either restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 7. Setting Up Valet Linux

Valet Linux provides a similar experience to Laravel Herd. First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install network-manager libnss3-tools jq xsel
```

Then, install Valet Linux:

```bash
composer global require cpriego/valet-linux
```

Restart your terminal and run the following command to complete the installation:

```bash
valet install
```

Create a directory for your Laravel projects (e.g., `Sites`):

```bash
mkdir ~/Sites
cd ~/Sites
```

Run `valet park` to set up the directory:

```bash
valet park
```

Now, when you create a new Laravel project, you can access it at `projectname.test`. For example:

```bash
laravel new blog
```

To secure the site with HTTPS:

```bash
valet secure blog
```

With these steps, you have effectively replicated Laravel Herd's free features on Linux. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out or explore solutions online.
